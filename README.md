# CISC2200 Spring 2024 Lab2

In this lab assignment, we practice **working with linked list**, **working with class template**,
and **understanding testcases**.

## Download starter code

From your terminal (mac or WSL/Ubunto) window, you can use the following command to download it:
```
git clone https://github.com/CISC2200-Spring2024/lab2.git
```

## Programming Environment Setup
If you haven't done so already, please set up programming environment our our own computer, by following [Setup Tutorial](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/). 

- The _Commannd Line Tools_ are required. 

- The _C++ Dev Environment_ (VSCode) is highly recommened.

**Please follow these tutorials closely and carefully.**

## Requirements

The class template **SLList** as studied in the class is defined in the **SLList.h** provided.

Please implement the following member functions, **iteratively (i.e., without using recursion)** in the **SLList.h**. The pseudocode for these 
linked list manipulation will be discussed in class. 

0. (Optional but helpful for debugging) Add a member function **display()** to display to the terminal the items stored in the list.
1. Implement the copy constructor, note that you need to perform deep-copy 
2. Implement  **geti()** member function 
3. Implement **removeFirst()** member function
4. Implement **removeLast()**  member function
5. Implement **insertAt()** member function
